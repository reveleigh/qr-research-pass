# QR research pass
A simple QR code generator aimed at teachers 

##Quick QR code 
Users write or paste a url into an input to quickly make a QR code which can be downloaded and used elsewhere. 

##Research Pass
Optionally, teachers can add extra details about the url to create a research card in the style of plane boarding pass. The idea is to encourage students to consider who produces websites they use for research, how websites are hosted and whether they use a secure connection.

The site uses Kazuhiko Arase's javaScript QR project found at http://www.d-project.com/
